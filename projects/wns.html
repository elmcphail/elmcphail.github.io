            <h2 id="wns-h2">The Wellington Night Shelter (WNS) is a Wellington-based charity providing emergency overnight accommodation for men experiencing homelessness.</h2>
            <h3>WELLINGTON NIGHT SHELTER</h3>
            <p>The WNS relies heavily on donations and community support. Their website has key information and links for how people can help. It is also used by other organisations and services to contact the shelter. Improving the website to make it functional and easy to update could have a really positive impact for the shelter.</p>

            <div class="text-container">
            <h3>KEY DESIGN DECISION - IMAGES</h3>
            <p>It was important for the WNS to be able to update their website easily and that the layouts suit the type of content they have. Their current site has very few images. It was therefore very important not to rely on imagery in the designs. We created flexible designs that worked with or without feature images, using the signature colours to add interest throughout.</p>
            <h3>ACCESSIBILITY & EASE OF USE</h3>
            <p>It was important to ensure that all the text colour combinations met accessibility guidelines so that the site was accessible for everyone who needed to use it. We also added an alert box to every page of the site so that anyone needing emergency information could quickly and easily access that information.</p>

            <h3>RESPONSE</h3>
            <p>The website was presented to the Wellington Night Shelter. They were really excited about the new site and the way it was designed to be easy for them to update and change whenever they needed.</p>
